Switch is a powerful parallel processor of data. With the emergence of programmbel data plane, it is possible to leverage the computation power in the data plane, but there lacks the tools for programmers. \sys is a framework to allow users to offload computation to the data plane. It enables Map-Reduce style data flow computation in the datacenter fabric. \sys enables information aggregation in the data plane, which reduces the traffic and lessons the load in servers.
