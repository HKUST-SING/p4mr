\section{Conclusion}
% This paper introduced power line communication to DCN. We demonstrate the usefulness of power line communication as a out-of-band control channel with deployment of actual DCN applications. To facilitate deployment, we designed \sys, a power supply unit for rack-mounted servers in DCN. We evaluate \sys on a  realistic testbed of 8 servers.
