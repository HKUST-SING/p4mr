\section{Background}
\subsection{Data plane compuation: fixed functions}
There are many compuation functions that are already in fixed function switches.

\subsection{Programmable data plane and P4}
With P4, data plane becomes more and more programmable.

\subsection{Programming models for parallel computing}
Many programming models for parallel computing on distributed devices. We consider circuit, actor, dataflow models are suitable for a parallel programming framework for P4.
